# About me

Hey! I am [Sushant Padha](https://github.com/Sushant-Padha). I am a 15-year old hobby programmer from India.

I originally started learning Python in 2019. I had always been interested by math and logic so I pursued programming as a hobby.
I am interested in algorithmic programming and problem solving through programming. I am looking forward to learning more about it, using Julia and Python.

Also, Python is the best (scripting) language, OOP is great and tabs are better than spaces!
